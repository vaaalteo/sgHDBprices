# sgHDBprices
A short project to understand the demand and trends of Singapore's HDB prices

This project was done as a requirement for the Specialist Diploma in Data Analytics course.

3 datasets were extracted from the Housing Development Board's website. 
For each dataset used, Numpy package was used to extract statistical or summary information about the data and Matplotlib to produce useful data visualisations.
The challenge is to extract without the use of pandas and visualise without seaborn.
